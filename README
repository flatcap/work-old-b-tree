	This is the source code for a variable-length key variable
page size b+tree library. Also included is source for a variety of
test programs, a semi-useable record manager, and a dbm-lookalike
library built on top of the record manager and b+tree. (dbm(3) will
blow it away performance-wise, of course).

	This software has been tested (and works) on the following:
Pyramid/OSx, Sun4/SunOs, Sun3/SunOs, Digital Vax/BSD4.3,
Digital DECstation3100/Ultrix

	This software has been tested and found NOT to work on the
following:
SCO Xenix - I have no idea why because I don't have one

btdbmlib	- source for a sort of record management library

		dbm-clone library that uses b+tree indexes.
		the record manager was designed for an application
